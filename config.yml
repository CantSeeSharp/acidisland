# Config for AcidIsland
general:
   # Sea level height (don't changes this mid-game unless you delete the world)
   # Minimum is 0, which means you are playing sky block!
   # If you really want to make it sky block, use a sky block schematic and set
   # acid damage to zero. This mode is NOT supported.
   # Another interesting sea-level is 38 or so. <40 means slimes can spawn on islands
   # easily.
   sealevel: 50

   # Island level - the height of the island.
   # Height should not be lower than sea level, but can be if you have an
   # island schematic that supports it
   # Lowest level is 5
   islandlevel: 50

   # Name of the AcidIsland world - if it does not exist then it will be generated
   worldName: AcidIsland

   # Create Nether - if this is false, the nether world will not be made and access to
   # AcidIsland control of the nether will not occur. Other plugins may still enable
   # portal usage.
   # Note: Some challenges will not be possible if there is no nether.
   # Note that in AcidIsland, all players arrive at the same portal and entering a
   # portal will return them back to their islands.
   createnether: true

   #How long a player must wait before they can reset their island again
   resetwait: 300
   #How many resets a player is allowed (override with /acid clearreset <player>
   #Value of -1 means unlimited, 0 means hardcore - no resets.
   #Example, 2 resets means they get 2 resets or 3 islands lifetime
   resetlimit: 2

   # Ops receive damage from acid (Set to true if you want Ops to play properly)
   damageops: false

   # Acid damage to player per second by being in acid if they have no armor on.
   # A fully health player has 20 health points. Players will regen some health

   # Damage type to apply in addition to acid damage
   # Types can be : SLOW, SLOW_DIGGING, CONFUSION,BLINDNESS, HUNGER, WEAKNESS and POISON
   # If you just want these to act, then make the acid damage 0 above
   # Note - these are potion effects and so can be cured by milk
   damagetype:

   # Removing mobs - this kills all monsters in the vicinity. Benefit is that it helps

   #[integer] Sets the limit for number of animals that can spawn in a chunk in this world. 
   # Note: If set to a negative number the world will use the server-wide spawn limit instead.

   # Reset Money - if this is true, AcidIsland will reset the player's money to
   # the starting money (see below) when they start an island or reset
   resetmoney: true

   # Starting money - this is how much money new players will have as their balance at the start of an island. (Default is zero)

   # Reset Challenges - if this is true, player's challenges will reset when they
   # reset an island
   resetchallenges: true

   # Reset inventory - if true, the player's inventory will be cleared when they start
   # or restart and island. Default is true.
   # Note: if you have MultiInv running or a similar inventory control plugin, that
   # plugin may still reset the inventory when the world changes.
   resetinventory: true

   # Nether spawn protection radius - this is the distance around the AcidIsland_nether spawn point that will be protected from player interaction (breaking blocks, pouring lava etc.). Minimum is 0 (not recommended), maximum is 100. Default is 25.

sponge:
   # Sponge Saturation [true or false]
   # Add more realism to sponges by making them only
   # absorb water from an area without blocking
   # water's flow afterwards.
   spongeSaturation: false

   # Water Replacement
   #	Can a player place water near a sponge
   #	while it is still there?
   canPlaceWater: false

   # Lava
   #	Should lava be affected also? Lava will be treated
   #	exactly like water as chosen in the other settings.
   absorbLava: false

   # Debug Messages
   #	This tends to spam your console, so you'd be best
   #	served leaving this off unless you know what
   #	you're doing.
   debug: false

   # Fire
   #	Should fire be affected too??? It'll get treated
   #	just like the liquids.
   absorbFire: false

   # Fire Extinguisher
   #	This option only works when absorbFire is true.
   #	With this enabled, sponges will go out of their way
   #	to put out fires that try to burn any blocks within
   #	their effective area, adequately preventing the
   #	eternal burning bush effect.
   attackFire: false

   # Affected Radius
   #	Here you can choose how large the area the sponge affects
   #	will be. It is based on the numbers of blocks away from
   #	the sponge. For example, setting this to 2 will give you a
   #	5x5x5 block area. It's recommended that you do not set
   #	this value to high as the plugin must check every block
   #	in the set radius.
   spongeRadius: 2

   # Water Restoration
   #	After sponges are removed, they can leave ugly cascades
   #	of water. With this option turned on, sponges will
   #	expel their water when they are removed, thus allowing
   #	the water to be restored.
   restoreWater: true

   # Water Flowtime Multiplier
   #	This relates to the Water Restoration feature.
   #	It multiplies by the spongeRadius in order to calculate
   #	the amount of time water should be given to flow back.
   #	Radius * Multiplier :FlowTime (in Milliseconds)
   #	Ex: 2 x 600 :1200 milliseconds for water to restore itself.
   #	You only need to change it if your server is really slow.
   flowTimeMult: 600

   # Piston Effect
   #	Can pistons move sponges?
